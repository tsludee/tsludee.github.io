# tsluder.github.io

Project Objectives:
+ ~~Build a website using HTML, CSS~~
+ Add at least one interactive feature using JavaScript
+ ~~Use Git version control~~
+ ~~Use the command line and file navigation~~
+ ~~Develop locally on your computer~~
+ ~~Deploy your site to the web using GitHub Pages~~
+ OPTIONAL: Buy a custom domain name and have it point to your GitHub Pages website

## Where I'm stuck:
I have a pretty good foundation for my portfolio, but I am stuck trying to do a few things. Notably, I am having issues actually getting the website hosted... I have a domain, but pointing it to a host is the issue.
